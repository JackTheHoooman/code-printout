Python program to put text files into a PDF with titles and line numbers.
It also support line wrap which looks for the closest word end.

Was made for the stupid UNI requirement of code needing to be submitted in such a format.

It uses FPDF

The code is in `printout.py`, output is in `test.pdf` and all the other stuff are inputs. 
Yes I do realise the `example_code` is misleading.
